1. There are two Jupyter Notebook files, 
   - eda.ipynb is to plot the figures. The result is saved to `plots/` folder
   - preprocess.ipynb is the clean, transformation and joining process, it is only for backup purposes, the milestone
     doesn't require it. (The reason we have this file is because we have one person mainly working on outliers and eda, 
     another person working mainly on cleaning, transformation and joining)

2. To get all the result, just run the `main.py` file, it should generate everything in `plots/` and `results/` foloder
